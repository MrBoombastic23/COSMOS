# COSMOS
COSMOS OpenCV and Lane Detection
Uses filters, thresh values, and a region of interest to find road lanes, calculate their curvature using polynomials, and display them. Also can calculate
car position and offset to find vesc angles to autonomously navigate to the middle of the lane. This needs a lot of work. Also, if you are using lane lines with 
different colors, you must change the thresh values. Thanks!
